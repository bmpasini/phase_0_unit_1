1) In a static webpage HTML is responsible to the structure of the webpage while CSS takes care of the design. As I don't have much experience with web programming I would say that so far the main characteristics of HTML make sense to me.

2) It is good that you can use it to structure your website the way you want to. However, I didn't like the way that you have to divide it in "header" and "body." I don't understand yet why can't it be together all inside of one bracket.

3) I had already read about HTML and CSS, but I didn't understand as well as now. Fow me the structure of CSS makes a lot more of sense as I didnt know this "selector { property: value }" rule. Now the structure of CSS makes more sense to me.

4) I've looked into the book "HTML & CSS design and build websites" a few times.
