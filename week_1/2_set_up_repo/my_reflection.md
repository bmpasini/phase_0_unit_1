* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) Create a GitHub account, go to create a new repository, name it the way you want to, make it public and click on "Commit Repository." Now, download the GitHub app, open it and find this repository at it, then click to clone it to your computer.

2) Open Source means that anyone can get access to the source code of a project, so that anyone can modify it as they please. The person that modifies it should just get to know wat type of license this project has and follow its rules.

3) Open source is great! It means that anyone can contribute to an open source project, in a way that this person can also learn stuff from doing it. Also, it can help a developer gain time in his project if he finds an open source file that has already done a part of the coding he needs. People who uses open source should just know the license that this open source project uses, so that they can be in compliance with the law. It can make people nervous if they don't understand well the characteristics of the license, though. It doesn't feel like an utopia because many benefits of this practice can be listed and proved.

4) Licenses are important to protect the content of a project, so that people cannot use it to ends that are not regarded as appropriate by the first creator of it.

5) I didn't know the different types of licenses. Now I am aware of the differences and have a good reference for when I need to remember the details of each one of them.

6) I didn't research more about any topic...
