1) I've learned the difference between web and internet. Web is a program that requests and sends webpages using the internet, which is the system that connects all clients and servers. I've also learned what each programming language is for, regarding web development.

2) We have to remember that each HTML page has a different IP address whose "name" is the page name address.

3) I felt excited about it. I can't wait to be able to create more things on it!

4) I had 2 main "aha" moments: When I learned what each programming language is for and when I learned the difference between web and internet. I had an idea about them, but the concepts where only solidified now.

5) I didn't have to find other resources.
