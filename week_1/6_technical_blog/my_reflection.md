Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

At first, I was mad because the CSS configurations weren't working in the way I wanted, but with trial and error I improved it until it pleased me. Seeing the final result was exciting and fulfilling! I think that doing it was very helpful to my learning. I'm used to think that I don't learn anything for real unless I do apply the knowledge, and, the creation of the blog was a pretty good way to put the theory into practice.

Figuring out how to implement the CSS was cumbersome, but necessary. Now I have more confidence in it, despite not knowing exactly how to use it yet.

I felt that was pretty easy to implement the HTML part, but as I said, I was uncertain while implementing the CSS part.
