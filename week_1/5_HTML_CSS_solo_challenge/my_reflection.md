1) I don't understand why when I close the <span/> command the text characteristics don't go back to their former format. I don't understand why my sidebar is on the center of the page even though I used the command "float:right;". I've also created a list with only two bullets, but it shows me 4 bullets. I haven't found help for these issues.

2) I thought that I has understood all the concepts, but my web page doesn't seem to work in the way I wanted it to work.

3) Yes, I've learned what is shown on the "girls develop it" slides.

4) I am not confident on positioning the divs, as my CSS code doesn't work the way I expected.

5) I enjoyes writing the code.

6) Having to read all those slides are very tedious. I would prefer video classes a lot more.
