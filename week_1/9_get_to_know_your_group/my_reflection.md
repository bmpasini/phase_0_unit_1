Hi Dev Bootcampers!

My name is Bruno, I'm from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I've been living in New York for for 5 months as I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at NYU. I've never programmed seriously before, so attending DBC hopefully will be the way I'll get deep into it. I can meet for pairing sessions almost any day of the week. We can schedule it a few days in advance, or maybe we can already take advantage of the fact that we are having to use Google Calendar and try to schedule most of the pairing meetings all at once.. Anyway, here it goes my info:

Favorite websites: Facebook (I would be lying if I let if out of this list), Quora and Netflix
Thinking style: Concrete Random
VARK learning style: Aural

If you guys need some help with anything, I'll be glad to help! Good luck with your learning!

Best,
Bruno

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

It made me feel more confident, it seems that everybody is on the same page. I'm looking forward to working with everyone.
