# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
  * The Document Object Model is a convention used to make HTML and XML elements become Objects, in a way that you can use an Object-Oriented Programming language to make them dynamic. I don't understand exactly where it is and how can I see it working, I just know that it exists. I think that linking programming languages makes sense and it is good because gives us flexibility.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
  * The wordpress.com site is a lot more complicated and has much more information than my site.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
  * Chrome Web Tools is fun and very helpful, since now I can see the changes I make taking effect in real time. It is awesome for learning how each property work.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
  * I had 'aha' moments when playing with Chrome Web Tools. I learned a lot more stuff about webpages.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  * Not this time...
