  * Smartphones and tablets created a need for responsive web design.
  * Different technologies require different responses from a website, that's how new technology will change the web design.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
  * It think they use the web by hearing it. There are websites that reads the content to them. I knew a blind guy who was a developer, so I know that he must use the web in some way.
  * Yes, we should design and develop for them.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
