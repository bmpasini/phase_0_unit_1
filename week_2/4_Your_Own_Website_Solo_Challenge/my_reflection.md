# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
  * The design can be really difficult to be applied exactly.
  * The user experience also takes a lot of time to be applied.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
  * I liked a lot, but there was a time that debbuging was pissing me off. Specially in the part that I was trying to make my website follow exactly my wireframe.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  * I first made a scrap model online, then I sketched it by hand calculating all the heights and widths, then I developted it and finally I debbuged it.
  * What didn't work was the top-margin and bottom-margin that are related by percentage to the width instead of being related to the height. I did a rule of 3 to fix it, but if the website has a different size, the rule doesn't work anymore.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
  * I would like to improve this issue mentioned above. I also would like to make it more interactive.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
  * It was really difficult and time demanding to apply everything I learned.
  * I found a lot of super cool things.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
