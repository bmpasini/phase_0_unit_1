# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
  * The web standards are good. It makes possible to open any page on many browsers.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
  * It makes sense because the web pages should in fact have an "starting point" that if you don't make any modification, then it remains in a standard format.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
  * Yes, I do because it helps to better organize your website.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
  * This file is necessary to reset the page style after making modifications.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
  * I've used IE, Safari, Firefox and Chrome. I've noticed differences only a few times. I don't think it is good; all browsers display should be standardized.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  * Not this time.
