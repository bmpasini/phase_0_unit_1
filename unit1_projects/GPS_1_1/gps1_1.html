                <h1>What is Pair Programming?</h1>
                <p>Pair programming is an interactive learning experience where individuals work with a partner with a focus toward completing a specific goal. Pair programming allows for a diversity of ideas, techniques, and experiences. Ideas are exchanged and check by each individual - allowing for collaboration and proofreading. This dynamic can be very beneficial to the development environment, but not always. It is important that each individual have a specific role and the responsibilities of those roles be made clear and established between the two individuals.</p>
