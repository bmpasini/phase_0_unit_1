//I want to create two sets of integers.
//The first set of integers, which should be called oddlengthArray, is : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7
//The second set of integers, which should be called evenLengthArrayis: 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7 

//I want to create a main function “assert” which should accept three parameters—“test”, “message”, and “test_number”
//If this returns as true, the console log should record “test_number” and “true” and should return as true to the user.

//Here are some of the tests that "assert" could run and what you want the function to return in each case.

//I’d like to run 3 tests on sum

//First:
//Using assert, I want to test if sum is an instance of a Function. 
//If sum returns as false, then I want the error that Java throws to read “sum should be a function.” 
//If this returns as true, then I want to have the test number, which should be “1” returned. 

//Second:
//Using assert, I want to test if the sum of the oddLengthArray equals 27.
//If this test returns as false, I want the error that Java throws to read: “sum should return the sum of all elements in an array with an odd length”
//If this returns as true, then I want to have the test number, which should be “2” returned

//Third:
//Using assert, I want to test if the sum of the evenLengthArray equals 43.
//If this returns as false, then I want the error that Java throws to read ““sum should return the sum of all elements in an array with an even length”
//If this returns as true, then I want to have the test number, which should be “3” returned

//I’d now like to run 3 tests on mean.
//First:
//Using assert, I want to test if mean is an instance of a function.
//If mean returns as false, then I want to get a message that reads: “mean should be a Function”
//If mean returns true, I’d like to get the test number, which should be 4

//Second:
//Using assert, I want to test if the mean of the oddLengthArray is equal to 3.857142857142857
//If the mean doesn’t equal the number above then I want to get a message that reads:  "mean should return the average of all elements in an array with an odd length."
//If the mean does equal the number above, then I’d like to get the test number, which should be 5

//Third:
//Using assert, I want to test if the mean of the evenLengthArray is equal to 5.375
//If the mean doesn’t equal the number above then I want to get a message that reads:  "mean should return the average of all elements in an array with an odd length."
//If the mean does equal the number above, then I’d like to get the test number, which should be 6.

//Finally, I’d like to run 3 tests on median

//First:
//Using assert, I want to test if median is an instance of a function.
//If median returns as false, then I want to get a message that reads “median should be a Function”
//If median returns as true, then I’d like to get the test number which should be 7.

//Second:
//Using assert, I want to test if the median of OddLengthArray is equal to 4.
//If the median of OddLengthArray is not equal to 4, then I want to get a message that reads:  "median should return the median value of all elements in an array with an odd length."
//If the media of the OddLengthArray is equal to 4, then I want to get the test number which should be 8

//Third:
//Using assert, I want to test if the median of EvenLengthArray is equal to 5.5.
//If the median of EvenLengthArray is not equal to 5.5, then I want to get a message that reads:  "median should return the median value of all elements in an array with an odd length."
//If the media of the EvenLengthArray is equal to 5.5, then I want to get the test number which should be 9
