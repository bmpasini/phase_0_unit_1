## My Reflection

I had to access and read/watch all the content in all links provided in order to feel confident enough to start using Git on the Terminal. I even had to revise the most common terminal commands. Along with this challenge I tried to make sublime commands work on the Terminal. I improved my habilities with Terminal while doing that. It was very helpful to me. Also, I made sure to submit all my updates in the my_reflection file through the Terminal, which made my solidify my Git skill on the Terminal. This first task of week 3 was very beneficial to me. Now I feel confident enough to use only the Terminal to submit my repository modifications to GitHub. Also, now I'm actually enjoying using Terminal, because I discovered that I can access some directories in my computer that I didn't even know were there. Thanks DBC!
