## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
<!-- Your defnition here -->
The add command turns on the git features into a new file. In other words, it stages your files to commit them next.

#### branch
<!-- Your defnition here -->
A different branch is basically the same project copied into another "directory," where you can make modifications without changing the main file. It can be used for experimentation, or for other people work in the same project as you in parallel. After you can merge your branches to have only one official version of the project.

#### checkout
<!-- Your defnition here -->
The checkout command lets you changes between branches.

#### clone
<!-- Your defnition here -->
The clone command is used to clone a repository into a new directory.

#### commit
<!-- Your defnition here -->
The commit command takes a "snapshot" of your current work and saves it into your git log, so that you can check it out later and compare it to your previous commit (you previous "snapshot") to see what changed. This is the main feature of git.

#### fetch
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Download objects and refs from another repository

#### log
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Show commit logs

#### merge
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Merge two branches

#### pull

#### push

#### reset

## Release 6: Reflection

I had to access and read/watch all the content in all links provided in order to feel confident enough to start using Git on the Terminal. I even had to revise the most common terminal commands. Along with this challenge I tried to make sublime commands work on the Terminal. I improved my habilities with Terminal while doing that. It was very helpful to me. Also, I made sure to submit all my updates in the my_reflection file through the Terminal, which made my solidify my Git skill on the Terminal. This first task of week 3 was very beneficial to me. Now I feel confident enough to use only the Terminal to submit my repository modifications to GitHub. Also, now I'm actually enjoying using Terminal, because I discovered that I can access some directories in my computer that I didn't even know were there. Thanks DBC!
